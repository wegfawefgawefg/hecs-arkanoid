                    GAMEPLAY
--------------------------------------------------
try managing the balls velocity:
method 1: managed thing where you manage the velocity during the collision itself
method 2: just always setting the velocity after each physics step.

level advance state when all breakable blocks are gone
- 10 blocks cannot be broken, 

power up chance when block breaks
power up drifts down slowly
if you catch it with your paddle, it activates

----------
powerups:

ball speed up
ball split
paddle lasers
fire ball
paddle enlarge
paddle shrink
ball slow down

fixed: 
ball can get stuck between two blocks without colliding them
ball can leave the screen through the corners, so expand the walls a little bit

game doesnt end on last level lol
